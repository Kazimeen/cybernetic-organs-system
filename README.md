# cybernetic-organs-system
I am building a program about Cybernetic Organ Management Systems (COMS). It has 4 classes that include Main, Cybernetic Organ, Patient, and Organ Inventory. Each of these classes focuses on a specific critical portion of the program such as the Patient class focuses on the patient's age, name, medical history, installed organs, etc. Right now I have just laid the skeleton work of the program and I will continue to improve and build on it in the future.
